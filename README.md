## Weekly Requirements

1. The feature I was able to complete for this weeks requirements was the connection between the watch and phone. And to show it working, when clicking on the connect button in the watch, the connection view in the phone should change to a green and say "Device Connected"

2. Sadly, because of other assignments pushing my timeline behind, I wasn't able to get much more functionality into the projectv as wanted. I Also was getting stuck on setting up a page-based navigation in watch  after connecting to phone, and wasn' able to complete that correctly. If I have any more trouble with it I will try a new method to getting the player scores to show and work with the phone.
